Analysis, regression and classification of Red Wine Quality data 

Associated with ST 563 at NCSU, both regression and classification methods were applied to a dataset containing information on the quality on red wine from the North of Portugal. Quality and various chemical properties were measured, and the goal is to use the chemical factors to predict wine quality.
The goal of this analysis is to create (1) a predictive model to determine quality based on chemical factors of the wine as opposed to quality determined by the arbitrary opinions of tasters and (2) an interpretable model to help wine makers have a better understanding of how to increase their wine quality.

This project was developed as a group. My specific contriutions were: 
+ Analysis goal (2)
+ Logistic Regression Classification methods (section 4.1)
  + Multicollinearity and Black Box discussion in section 4.2.1 
+ Interpretability ideas 
+ Specifics about multicollinearity, including investegating VIF.
